Python is one of the most popular languages for machine learning and for that reason alone it's an interesting language. But it's also interesting because it demands a very particular way of writing code. It demands _Pythonic_ code.

Before I started the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree, I had relatively little experience with Python. Throughout the course, I analyzed or wrote a large amount of Python code. This post describes some functions and code snippets that I found to be  useful in learning Python in general, and also writing more _Pythonic_ code.
