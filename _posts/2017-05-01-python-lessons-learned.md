Python is an interesting language. It's one of the most popular languages for machine learning, and for that reason it's an interesting language. But it's also interesting because it seems to command -- and even demand -- a very particular way of writing code. It demands _Pythonic_ code.

Before I started the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree, I had relatively little experience with Python. Throughout the course, I analyzed or wrote a large amount of Python code. This post describes some functions and code snippets that I found to be  useful in learning Python in general, and also writing more _Pythonic_ code.
